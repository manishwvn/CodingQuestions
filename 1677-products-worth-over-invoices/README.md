<pre><strong>Input:</strong> 
Product table:
+------------+-------+
| product_id | name  |
+------------+-------+
| 0          | ham   |
| 1          | bacon |
+------------+-------+
Invoice table:
+------------+------------+------+------+----------+----------+
| invoice_id | product_id | rest | paid | canceled | refunded |
+------------+------------+------+------+----------+----------+
| 23         | 0          | 2    | 0    | 5        | 0        |
| 12         | 0          | 0    | 4    | 0        | 3        |
| 1          | 1          | 1    | 1    | 0        | 1        |

| 3          | 1          | 0    | 1    | 1        | 1        |
| 4          | 1          | 1    | 1    | 1        | 0        |
+------------+------------+------+------+----------+----------+
<strong>Output:</strong> 
+-------+------+------+----------+----------+
| name  | rest | paid | canceled | refunded |
+-------+------+------+----------+----------+
| bacon | 3    | 3    | 3        | 3        |
| ham   | 2    | 4    | 5        | 3        |
+-------+------+------+----------+----------+
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
- The amount of money left to pay for bacon is 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3
- The amount of money paid for bacon is 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 3
- The amount of money canceled for bacon is 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
- The amount of money refunded for bacon is 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3
- The amount of money left to pay for ham is 2 + 0 = 2
- The amount of money paid for ham is 0 + 4 = 4
- The amount of money canceled for ham is 5 + 0 = 5
- The amount of money refunded for ham is 0 + 3 = 3
